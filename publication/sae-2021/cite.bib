abstract = {Ensuring the equality of SMT solvers is critical due to its broad spectrum of applications in academia and industry, such as symbolic execution and program verification. Existing approaches to testing SMT solvers are either too costly or find difficulties generalizing to different solvers and theories, due to the test oracle problem. To complement existing approaches and overcome their weaknesses, this paper introduces skeletal approximation enumeration (SAE), a novel lightweight and general testing technique for all first-order theories. To demonstrate its practical utility, we have applied the SAE technique to test Z3 and CVC4, two comprehensively tested, state-of-the-art SMT solvers. By the time of writing, our approach had found 71 confirmed bugs in Z3 and CVC4,55 of which had already been fixed.},
