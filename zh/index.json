Thus, ensuring the correctness of DBMSs is critical for enterprise applications. Among various kinds of bugs, logical bugs, which make a DBMS return an incorrect result set for a given SQL query, are the most challenging for detection since they typically do not result in apparent manifestations (e.g., crashes) and are likely to go unnoticed by users. The key challenge of detecting logical bugs is the test oracle problem, i.e., how to automatically characterize the expected results for a given query. The state-of-theart approaches focus on generating the equivalent forms of queries via the customized rules, which rewrite a seed query to achieve the equivalent transformation. This dramatically limits the forms of SQL queries fed to the DBMS and thus leads to the under-reporting of many deeply-hidden logical bugs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, PINOLO, to constructing a test oracle for logical bugs. Instead of generating the equivalent mutants of a seed query, our idea is to synthesize the queries that theoretically should return a superset or a subset of the result set of the seed query, forming the over-approximations or under-approximations of the seed query. A logical bug is detected if the result set returned by our synthesized query does not follow the expected approximation relation. We implemented our idea as a DBMS testing system and evaluated it on four widely-used DBMSs: MySQL, MariaDB, TiDB, and OceanBase. By the time of writing, PINOLO has found 41 unique logical bugs in these DBMSs, 39 of which have been confirmed by developers.","tags":["DBMS","Logical bug"],"title":"Pinolo: Detecting Logical Bugs in Database Management Systems with Approximate Query Synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our database defect detection work has been accepted by ATC 2023.\nDetails of publications → ","date":1688169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1688169600,"objectID":"c635a2bcf1d9a2a7ae2bea24dd16eb6a","permalink":"https://s-cube-xmu.github.io/zh/post/atc2023/","publishdate":"2023-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/post/atc2023/","section":"post","summary":"Our database defect detection work has been accepted by ATC 2023.\n","tags":null,"title":"Our database defect detection work has been accepted by ATC 2023","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our accelerating build script error detection work has been accepted by ASE 2022.\nDetails of publications → ","date":1672876800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1672876800,"objectID":"cd746b89b3ed48d39f57cef24f5055ad","permalink":"https://s-cube-xmu.github.io/zh/post/virtualbuild2022/","publishdate":"2023-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/post/virtualbuild2022/","section":"post","summary":"Our accelerating build script error detection work has been accepted by ASE 2022.\n","tags":null,"title":"Our accelerating build script error detection work has been accepted by ASE 2022","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our database logical bugs detection work has been accepted by ASE 2022.\nDetails of publications → ","date":1672876800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1672876800,"objectID":"eaa1625650e159d5f8264d6755595a96","permalink":"https://s-cube-xmu.github.io/zh/post/smartpip2022/","publishdate":"2023-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/post/smartpip2022/","section":"post","summary":"Our database logical bugs detection work has been accepted by ASE 2022.\n","tags":null,"title":"Our python ecosystem management work has been accepted by ASE 2022","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://s-cube-xmu.github.io/zh/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://s-cube-xmu.github.io/zh/tour/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Rongxin Wu","Minglei Chen","Chengpeng Wang","Gang Fan","Jiguang Qiu","Charles Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":166536e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":166536e4,"objectID":"bae1b149564cc0cdc2b18f12c336134c","permalink":"https://s-cube-xmu.github.io/zh/publication/virtualbuild/","publishdate":"2023-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/virtualbuild/","section":"publication","summary":"Build scripts play an important role in transforming the source code into executable artifacts. However, the development of build scripts is typically error-prone. As one kind of the most prevalent errors in build scripts, the dependency-related errors, including missing dependencies and redundant dependencies, draw the attention of many researchers. A variety of build dependency analysis techniques have been proposed to tackle them. Unfortunately, most of these techniques, even the state-of-the-art ones, suffer from efficiency issues due to the expensive cost of monitoring the complete build process to build dynamic dependencies. Especially for large-scale projects, such the cost would not be affordable. This work presents a new technique to accelerate the build dependency error detection by reducing the time cost of the build monitoring. Our key idea is to reduce the size of a program while still preserving the same dynamic dependencies as the original one. Building the reduced program does not generate a real software artifact, but it yields the same list of dependency errors and meanwhile speeds up the process. We implement the tool VirtualBuild and evaluate it on real-world projects. It is shown that it detects all the dependency errors found by existing tools at a low cost. Compared with the state-of-the-art technique, VirtualBuild  accelerates the build process by 8.74 times, and improves the efficiency of error detection by 6.13 times on average. Specifically, in the large-scale project LLVM that contains 5.67 MLoC, VirtualBuild  reduces the overall time from over four hours to 38.63  minutes.","tags":["Build script","Dependency error","Build accelerate"],"title":"Accelerating Build Dependency Error Detection via Virtual Build","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chao Wang","Rongxin Wu*","Haohao Song","Jiwu Shu","Guoqing Li"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":166536e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":166536e4,"objectID":"93aeacaf3be87a4b6d10d7d7ab48b615","permalink":"https://s-cube-xmu.github.io/zh/publication/smartpip/","publishdate":"2023-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/smartpip/","section":"publication","summary":"As one of the representative software ecosystems, PyPI, together with the Python package management tool pip, greatly facilitates Python developers to automatically manage the reuse of third-party libraries, thus saving development time and cost. Despite its great success in practice, a recent empirical study revealed the risks of dependency conflict (DC) issues and then summarized the characteristics of DC issues. However, the dependency resolving strategy, which is the foundation of the prior study, has evolved to a new one, namely the backtracking strategy. To understand how the evolution of this dependency resolving strategy affects the prior findings, we conducted an empirical study to revisit the characteristics of DC issues under the new strategy. Our study revealed that, of the two previously discovered DC issue manifestation patterns, one has significantly changed (Pattern A), while the other remained the same (Pattern B). We also observed, the resolving strategy for the DC issues of Pattern A suffers from the efficiency issue, while the one for the DC issues of Pattern B would lead to a waste of time and space. Based on our findings, we propose a tool smartPip  to overcome the limitations of the resolving strategies. To resolve the DC issues of Pattern A, instead of iteratively verifying each candidate dependency library, we leverage a pre-built knowledge base of library dependencies to collect version constraints for concerned libraries, and then convert the version constraints into the SMT expressions for solving. To resolve the DC issues of Pattern B, we improve the existing virtual environment solution to reuse the local libraries as far as possible. Finally, we evaluated smartPip  in three benchmark datasets of open source projects. The results showed that, smartPip  can outperform the existing Python package management tools including pip with the new strategy and Conda in resolving DC issues of Pattern A, and achieve 1.19X - 1.60X speedups over the best baseline approach. Compared with the built-in Python virtual environment (venv), smartPip  reduced 34.55% - 80.26% of storage space and achieved up to 2.26X - 6.53X speedups in resolving the DC issues of Pattern B.","tags":["Python","Dependency conflict","Dependency resolving"],"title":"smartPip: A Smart Approach to Resolving Python Dependency Conflict Issues","type":"publication"}]
